For 4 glasses.

In a blender, combine coconut rum, light rum, and strawberries. Blend to a puree. Transfer to a clean pitcher.  
Clean and wash out blender. Add pineapple juice, cream of coconut, and crushed ice. Blend until smooth.  
Divide strawberry rum puree among 4 serving classes. Slowly pour pineapple coconut mixture into the glass. The red mixture will evenly swirl with the white mixture.  
Garnish with a pineapple wedge and serve immediately.
